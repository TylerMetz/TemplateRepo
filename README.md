# TemplateRepo
## Basic Layout
All project files will be in src/code,
src/main.cpp compiles the main project,
t/main.cpp runs all tests,
t/test.cpp holds an example test using code.h,
## Compiling from terminal
The two bash scripts are app and tdd.
To compile just the tests without main runnings you will execute ./tdd,
To compile main without the tests running execute ./app

## Script Permission
If those scripts do not run go into terminal in this directory and do
"chmod +x <scriptName>.sh"
